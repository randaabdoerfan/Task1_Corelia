# ðŸ–¥ JavaScript Fundamentals Practice

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is a simple JavaScript practice script that demonstrates:
- Variables (`let` / `const`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Basic interactivity using `prompt`
- Console output for results

The script asks the user for their name, shows a multiplication table for a given number, and calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number.

1. **Display Name**  
   Prints a predefined name to the console.

2. **Greet User**

3. **Multiplication Table**  
   Prompts the user for a number and prints its multiplication table (1 to 10).

4. **Sum of Numbers**  
   Prompts the user for a number and calculates the sum from 1 up to that number using a `while` loop.

5. **Validation**  
   Checks if the user entered a valid number greater than zero before performing calculations.
